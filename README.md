## Features of API Dash

### Create & Customize API Requests

### Visually inspect API Responses
Using API Dash, you can:
- Inspect the API Response (HTTP status code, error message, headers, body, time taken)
- View formatted code previews for responses of various content types like JSON, XML, YAML, HTML, SQL, etc.
- For APIs which return results as images, API Dash helps you save a lot of time by directly previewing these results and supports a wide variety of image file formats such as jpeg, png, gif, etc.

### Generate Dart Code Automatically
API Dash is the **only** open source API client that supports advanced Dart code generation so that you can easily integrate APIs in your Dart/Flutter project.
For each request, you can click on **View Code** to directly view the corresponding Dart code which you can then *Copy* and directly run it on DartPad.
