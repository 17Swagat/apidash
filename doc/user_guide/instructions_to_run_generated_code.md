## Dart (http)

Here are the detailed instructions for running the generated API Dash code in **Dart (using `http`)** for macOS, Windows, and Linux:  

---

### **1. Install Dart**  
To run Dart code, you need to install the Dart SDK.  

- Visit the official **[Dart Installation Guide](https://dart.dev/get-dart)** for step-by-step instructions for macOS, Windows, and Linux.  
- Follow the guide to install Dart globally on your system.  

---

### **2. Add the `http` Package**  
To use the `http` package in Dart, you need to add it as a dependency in your project.  

1. Create a new Dart project by running the following command in the terminal:  
   ```bash
   dart create my_dart_project
   cd my_dart_project
   ```  
2. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file in the project directory.  
3. Add the following line under the `dependencies` section:  
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     http: ^1.2.2
   ```  
4. Run the following command to fetch the dependency:  
   ```bash
   dart pub get
   ```

---

### **3. Run the Generated Code**  
After setting up Dart and the `http` package, follow these steps to execute the generated code:  

#### **Using a Text Editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code):**
1. Open a text editor or an IDE like Visual Studio Code.  
2. Create a new Dart file, such as `api_test.dart`.  
3. Copy the generated code from API Dash and paste it into this file.  
4. Save the file.  
5. Run the Dart file using the terminal or the IDE's built-in tools.  

#### **Using the Command Line:**
1. Save the generated code to a Dart file, e.g., `api_test.dart`.  
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.  
3. Run the Dart file with the following command:  
   ```bash
   dart run api_test.dart
   ```

With these steps, you can successfully run API Dash-generated code in Dart using the `http` package! ðŸš€

## Dart (dio)

Here are the detailed instructions for running the generated API Dash code in **Dart (using `dio`)** for macOS, Windows, and Linux:

---

### **1. Install Dart**  
To run Dart code, you need to install the Dart SDK.  

ðŸ‘‰ Follow the instructions provided above under **Dart (http)** for detailed steps on how to install Dart on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

---

### **2. Add the `dio` Package**  
To use the `dio` package in Dart, you need to add it as a dependency in your project.  

1. Create a new Dart project by running the following command in the terminal:  
   ```bash
   dart create my_dart_project
   cd my_dart_project
   ```  
2. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file in the project directory.  
3. Add the following line under the `dependencies` section:  
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     dio: ^5.7.0
   ```  
4. Run the following command to fetch the dependency:  
   ```bash
   dart pub get
   ```
---

### **3. Run the Generated Code**  
After setting up Dart and the `dio` package, follow these steps to execute the generated code:

ðŸ‘‰ Refer to the instructions under **Dart (http)** for details on how to execute the Dart file using an IDE or the terminal.

With these steps, you can successfully run API Dash-generated code in Dart using the `dio` package! ðŸš€
